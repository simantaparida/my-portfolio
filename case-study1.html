                <h3>User Persona</h3>
                <p>To help me think from the user’s perspective, I created 2 fictional personas featuring 2 prime user types based on the input from the client and ran them through the Product Manager to get the initial feedback.</p>
                <p>I wanted to make sure that the people using my designs had the best experience possible, so I came up with 2 user personas. This helped me get to know my users better and understand what they wanted and needed from the website.</p>
