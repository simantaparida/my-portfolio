                        <p>when i was in school, i was famous for my drawing and sketching skills , but engineering made me fall in love with technology. when i learned about ui/ux, it was like love at first sight.</p>
                        <p>apart from designing, i love travelling new places, bike road trips, and playing with my pet (doodle, the beagle) which helps me stay creative.</p>
                        <p>i'm a vegetarian but sometimes i eat fish & eggs (please, don't judge me)</p>
